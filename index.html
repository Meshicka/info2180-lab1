        <h2>Meshicka Brown</h2>
        <p>My name is Meshicka Brown. I am currently a second-year student. Since the start of the semester, my new hobbies have been sleeping and studying. This is my daily routine every day. The only fun part of my day is when I get to take care of my cats. I absolutely love being around them, and they bring me a sense of peace and joy. In the end, itâ€™s all worth the effort.
<br><br>
I am interested in web development because the art of creating, styling, and making websites interactive and dynamic fascinates me. It allows me to bring ideas to life on the web and create engaging experiences for users.</p>
